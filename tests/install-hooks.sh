# Regression test for the two defects that broke the offline install for users:
#
#   1. The initramfs mask was laid at /mnt/etc/pacman.d/hooks/90-mkinitcpio-install.hook
#      BEFORE pacstrap. limine-mkinitcpio-hook ships that exact path, so pacman
#      aborted the whole transaction with "exists in filesystem" and no packages
#      were installed. The mask must land after pacstrap, and must move a
#      package-owned file aside rather than clobber it, so restore hands it back.
#
#   2. The retry paths ran `pacstrap -K --needed /mnt ...`. pacstrap parses only
#      short options (getopts ':C:cDGiKMNPU'), so a long option before the root
#      died with "pacstrap: invalid option -- '-'" and the real pacman error was
#      never surfaced. pacman flags belong after the root, where pacstrap passes
#      them through as targets.
