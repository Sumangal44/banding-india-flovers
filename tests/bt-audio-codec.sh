# hermetic test for ryoku-bt-audio: the per-device Bluetooth codec memory.
#
# The codec order in 51-ryoku-bluetooth.conf is global (bluez5.codecs is a
# MONITOR property), and WirePlumber persists the bluetooth PROFILE but not the
# codec. So a user who prefers AAC on one device has to re-pick it on every
# reconnect. This helper is the memory that closes that gap, and these are the
# behaviours that make it trustworthy rather than annoying:
#
#   - a codec the device never offered is refused, because remembering one means
#     retrying a doomed switch on every single reconnect
#   - a device already on the wanted codec is left alone, because the switch
#     renegotiates the A2DP link and audibly drops audio
#   - apply only touches devices that have a remembered choice
#
# Both seams point at fixtures: RYOKU_BT_PACTL (a fake pactl that records what it
# was asked to do) and RYOKU_BT_CONFIG (the memory, inside the tmp dir, so the
# real ~/.config/ryoku/bluetooth.json is never read or written; asserted at the
# end). No PipeWire, no Bluetooth device, no root.
