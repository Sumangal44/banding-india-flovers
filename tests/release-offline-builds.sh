# Every [ryoku] package must build without resolving dependencies over the
# network. Pinned, checksummed source=() downloads are fine; unpinned dependency
# resolution is not, because it is neither verifiable nor available offline.
#
# Two regressions this pins:
#   1. limine-mkinitcpio-hook let Gradle resolve org.graalvm.buildtools.native
#      from the plugin portal. A portal hiccup failed the publish gate with
#      "Plugin [id: 'org.graalvm.buildtools.native'] was not found", so no user
#      got the update. The plugin is vendored in release/gradle-offline/repo and
#      resolved from there first. Their compile deps and the plugin's
#      reachability-metadata zip are not vendored yet, so these two builds are
#      not fully offline and --offline is deliberately not asserted.
#   2. ryoku-hub and ryoku-rashin ran a bare `go build`, which downloads modules
#      from proxy.golang.org. They build -mod=vendor from a committed vendor/.
